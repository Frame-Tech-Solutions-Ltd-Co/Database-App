# Database App

This is a database app project developed using Python and Django.

## Project Overview

The database app aims to provide various functionalities for managing user authentication, credit system, database interaction, record access, alert system, API integration, and user/company profiles. The app allows users to sign up, sign in, and use credits to access specific records in the database. It also provides search and filter functionality, alerts for record changes, and the ability to access records through an API.

## Features

- User authentication with phone number two-factor authentication during sign up.
- Credit system for users to access the database and use credits to access specific records.
- Search and filter functionality to find records based on various criteria.
- Alert system to notify users of changes in accessed records.
- API integration to access records programmatically.
- User and company profiles with a clean and modern design.
- Scalability to handle millions of records.

## Installation
